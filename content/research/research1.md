<span style="font-size: 0.7em; line-height: 12px;">**Advanced fabrication of graphene and related layered structures** 
Wrinkles invariably form during graphene growth and post-transfer processes and limit the large-scale uniformity of graphene films for electronic applications. Here we study a transfer-free synthesis route of highly-uniform graphene directly on insulating substrates by interfacial carbon precipitation. Research focuses on:</span>

* <span style="font-size: 0.7em;">metal-substrate stability at elevated temperatures
* <span style="font-size: 0.7em;">precipitation control at the metal-substrate interface
* <span style="font-size: 0.7em;">interfacial synthesis of graphene on complex nanostructured interface
* <span style="font-size: 0.7em;">heterogeneous integration by interfacial synthesis, etc.

abstract: A practical route to exploiting graphene’s supreme properties for a
  variety of applications is to incorporate graphene layers in composite
  materials. Harnessing the high stiffness, intrinsic strength as well as
  transport properties of graphene in its composites requires the combination of
  high-quality graphene having low defect density, and the precise control of
  the interfacial interactions between the graphene and the matrix. These
  requirements equally hold for polymer and metal matrices, and enable the use
  of graphene in applications ranging from tough thin films for use in flexible
  electronics to the design of advanced aerospace structures. My dissertation
  addresses the synthesis, understanding and control of these composites and
  their mechanical properties probed from the nano- to the microscales. To this
  end, a model system of ultrathin metal films coated with graphene monolayer
  via chemical vapor deposition (CVD) is designed and used to study as-grown
  graphene’s contributions in graphene-metal composite thin films. Due to the
  thinness of the metal layer - typically less than 300 nm - individual or few
  graphene layers have a strong contribution on the composite thin film’s
  mechanics. To create the most ideal interface between the metal and the
  graphene, CVD synthesis is used to grow the graphene wrapping around the
  surface of the films. A highly dynamic CVD synthesis route is developed to
  achieve high-quality graphene monolayer growth on ultrathin metal films while
  avoiding solid-state dewetting instability which takes place at the extremely
  high synthesis temperatures. We study how the competition between
  temperature-driven segregation and precipitation of carbon radicals governs
  the graphene’s nucleation and growth kinetics on ultrathin metal catalysts.
  The result of the dynamic recipe is repeatable growth of graphene monolayers
  with ultralow defect density as confirmed by Raman spectroscopy. Precise
  mechanical characterization of ultrathin films is carried using various
  nanoindentation modalities including indentation of supported and freestanding
  thin films. CVD grown graphene-metal thin film composites exhibit unusual
  increase in the elastic modulus, strength and toughness. For example, there is
  35 % and 57 % increases in the Young’s modulus and tensile strength in
  graphene-palladium thin film composites compared to those for a bare palladium
  film having a thickness of 66 nm. Notably, this enhancement exhibits scale
  effects, where the composite modulus increase varies with the thickness, and
  is highest for the thinnest metal thicknesses. My work demonstrates that the
  inherent strong interfaces between graphene and strongly interacting metals
  like Ni and Pd after synthesis could lead to the manufacturing of composites
  with significantly higher performances. I also observed increase in toughness
  and qualitatively different modes of crack propagation owing to the addition
  of the high stiffness graphene shield on the metal surface during synthesis.
  Raman spectroscopy and electron imaging of surface reconstructions confirm the
  high interfacial stresses due to the combination of the lattice mismatch
  between the graphene and the metals and the kinetics of growth. The findings
  of this dissertation promote graphene-based thin film composites for flexible
  electronic devices, and enable fundamental studies of exploiting strain
  engineering at the graphene-metal interface for electronics, chemistry and
  mechanics. Furthermore, the results of this dissertation are broadly relevant
  to the design of bulk graphene-based composite materials.

In 2022 Fall, I will be teaching a SMMG PG course: Fundamentals in Metal Processing [3-0-0:3]

This course introduces a wide range of manufacturing processes for metal materials, including machining, casting, 3D printing, and heat treatment; and explains the fundamental and practical aspects of manufacturing at scale. For each process, this course explains the underlying physical principles, provides several examples and demonstrations. The course concludes with a perspective on sustainability and the worldwide trajectory of metal manufacturing. The objectives of this course are to enable the students to:</span>

* <span style="font-size: 1em;">**Learn the fundamentals and applications of a variety of metal manufacturing processes, including machining, casting, sheet metal forming, additive manufacturing, and heat treatment.**
* <span style="font-size: 1em;">**Mechanical behaviors and characterization of metals.**
* <span style="font-size: 1em;">**Evaluate the performance of metal processing, machines, and systems by key attributes like rate, coast, quality and flexibility.**
* <span style="font-size: 1em;">**Understand sources of variation in metal manufacturing processes, and how to monitor and control variation.**
* <span style="font-size: 1em;">**Learn how to design and plan a multi-step metal manufacturing process, and important life-cycle considerations of mass-produced products.**

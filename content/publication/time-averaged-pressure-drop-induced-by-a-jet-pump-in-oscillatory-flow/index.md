abstract: Gedeon streaming is known to considerably deteriorate the thermal
  efficiency of a traveling-wave thermoacoustic engine with looped
  configuration. The time-average pressure drop induced by a jet pump can
  efficiently suppress the Gedeon streaming. In this study, such suppression
  mechanism of the jet pump is investigated, and the emphasis is put on the
  effects of the dimensionless rounding, the taper angle, and the
  cross-sectional area ratio. An experimental apparatus has been set up to
  measure the time-averaged pressure drop induced by the jet pumps in
  oscillatory flow. Controlled experiments and characterization reveal the
  time-averaged pressure drop and working efficiency increase with a rise in
  dimensionless rounding when it is less than 0.15. For jet pumps with the fixed
  opening areas, the taper angle in the range from 3° to 9° is capable of
  producing a larger time-averaged pressure drop with a higher working
  efficiency, and the change of taper angle has little effect on the
  performance. However, performance degradation is observed as the taper angle
  increases beyond 9°. Moreover, when the taper angle ranges from 3° to 9°, the
  time-averaged pressure drop and working efficiency can be improved by
  increasing the cross-sectional area ratio.

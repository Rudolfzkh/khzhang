In 2022 Spring, I will be teaching special topic course at MAE: Advanced Additive Manufacturing [3-0-0:3]

This course provides students with the latest knowledge and skills for metal additive manufacturing (AM) techniques and implications and the fundamental understanding of process-structure-property relationships in metal processing using AM. The objectives of this course are to enable the students to:

•	Acquire a comprehensive knowledge of the major processes and techniques used in AM of metallic materials.
•	Identify the physics and critical processing parameters in current metal AM techniques.
•	Obtain a systematic understanding of process-structure-property relationships across different length scales in metal AM processes.
•	Understand the latest industrial and academic challenges and opportunities in metal AM.
•	Acquire the skills and confidence to create innovative solutions using AM across a vast opportunity space.

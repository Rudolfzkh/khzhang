abstract: Owing to the superior strength and atomic thickness of graphene, it
  can in theory reinforce metals beyond the usual rule of mixtures bounds by
  constraining dislocations motion and strain localization at the grain
  boundaries. This unusual enhancement relies on the graphene's ability to
  conform to and wrap metal grains. This study experimentally probes the limits
  of this behavior and investigates the role of interface in designing superior
  graphene composites. Free‐standing nickel–multilayer graphene (Ni–MLG)
  nanomembranes are fabricated by in situ chemical vapor deposition. Using
  nanoindentation, elastic modulus (285.16 GPa), maximum stress (2.35 GPa), and
  toughness (1407.26 Jm−2) are measured, and these values exceed the rule of
  mixtures bounds. The multi‐frequency atomic force microscopy (AFM) is used to
  spatially map the elastic properties and topography of the MLG on Ni grain
  boundaries. This emerging characterization reveals that effective
  reinforcement is achieved when graphene conforms and bridges the grain
  texture. Nanoindentation and AFM confirm that these mechanisms are ineffective
  in non‐conformally attached Ni–MLG composites, which exhibit significantly
  weaker mechanical behavior. These results guide the design of effective
  graphene composites by highlighting the importance of nanoscale roughness and
  interfaces, and clearly demonstrate the superiority of composite processing
  routes based on in situ graphene synthesis.

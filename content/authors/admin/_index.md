Kaihao Zhang is a postdoc associate in MechanoSynthesis Group in the Department of Mechanical Engineering at MIT. His research at MIT focuses on (i) hybrid metal additive manufacturing technique based on drop-wise digital printing of metal droplets, and (ii) interfacial chemical vapor deposition synthesis of uniform graphene directly on dielectric substrates.

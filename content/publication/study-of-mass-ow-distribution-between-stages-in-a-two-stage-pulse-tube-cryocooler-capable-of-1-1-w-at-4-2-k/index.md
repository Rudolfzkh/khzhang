abstract: The mass flow distribution among stages is important for design and
  optimization of multi-stage cryocoolers, which has been seldom investigated
  due to the complicated mutual interference among stages. The cooling
  performance’s dependence on operating parameters was investigated in a
  home-made separate two-stage pulse tube cryocooler (PTC), in which mass flow
  to each stage can be conveniently adjusted. The numerical study revealed the
  dependence of cooling performance of the second stage on mass flow rate and
  precooling temperatures. The experiments with different mass flow rates were
  performed and results agreed well with simulation. Cooling power of 0.7 W at
  4.2 K was obtained with single-compressor and mass flow rate of 3 g s−1 on the
  second stage; in the two-compressor driving mode, 1.1 W at 4.2 K was achieved
  with input power of 11.7 kW, which is the largest cooling power ever obtained
  at liquid helium temperatures in a separate PTC.

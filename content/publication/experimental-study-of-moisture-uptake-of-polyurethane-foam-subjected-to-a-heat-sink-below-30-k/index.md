abstract: Rigid closed-cell foam is widely used to thermally insulate liquid
  hydrogen and oxygen tanks of space launch vehicles due to its lightweight,
  mechanical strength and thermal-insulating performance. Up to now, little
  information is available on the intrusion of moisture into the foam that
  subjects one side to liquid hydrogen temperatures and the other side to room
  temperatures and high relative humidity. A novel cryogenic moisture uptake
  apparatus has been designed and fabricated to measure the moisture uptake into
  the polyurethane foam. For safety and convenience, two identical single-stage
  pulse tube cryocoolers instead of liquid hydrogen are used to cool one side of
  the foam specimen to the lowest temperature of 26 K. Total of eight specimens
  in three groups, according to whether there is a butt-joint or weathering
  period, are tested respectively for both 5 h and 9 h. The additional weight
  due to moisture uptake of the foam for the 26 K cases is compared to previous
  measurements at 79 K. The results are instructive for the applications of foam
  to the insulation of liquid hydrogen tanks in space launch vehicles.

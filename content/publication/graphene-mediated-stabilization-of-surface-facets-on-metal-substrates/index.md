abstract: After Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD), faceted structures are
  routinely observed on a variety of metal catalyst surfaces in the
  graphene-covered regions. In spite of having its bare surface flattened
  through high diffusivity and surface pre-melting at high temperatures, the
  graphene-covered copper surface still presents faceted structures. Using
  atomistic simulations, we show the role of graphene in the preservation of the
  faceted surface morphology at the graphene–copper interface, manifesting as a
  suppressant against surface melting and surface-specific diffusion. The
  results of our molecular dynamics simulations are consistent with our
  experimental observations and demonstrate the thermo-mechanical interfacial
  surface stabilization role of graphene. Our study provides an understanding
  applicable to most metal–graphene interfaces and is especially relevant to
  most metallic catalysts for graphene growth by CVD. Understanding the
  interaction between graphene and the catalyst surface structure is critical
  for producing ultra-flat and defect-free graphene.

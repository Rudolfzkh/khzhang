abstract: This study addresses the synthesis and mechanical behavior of
  graphene-metal composites comprising palladium (Pd) nanoribbons wrapped with
  graphene. Coating Pd nanoribbons with graphene by chemical vapor deposition
  (CVD) considerably increases their elastic modulus. These measurements are
  made by suspended microbridge indentation. A refined indentation measurement
  approach carefully takes into consideration the uncertainty resulting from the
  non-ideal bridge geometry. The measured composite moduli depend on the ribbon
  thickness in the range of 36â€“250 nm, with the maximum modulus of 147 GPa
  measured for 36 nm thick nanoribbons, representing an increase of 41.6% over
  uncoated Pd nanoribbons. The results clearly demonstrate that graphene, owing
  to its high modulus and strong interaction with Pd, can effectively reinforce
  Pd nanoribbons up to thickness of 250 nm, which corresponds to a volume
  fraction of 0.54%. We study the modulus scaling by deriving a mathematical
  rule of mixture model considering 3D 'bulk' metal nanoribbons reinforced by
  the 2D graphene 'surface'. This modeling approach is inspired by the framework
  of surface modulus, which is typically employed to explain the deviations in
  the moduli of nanowires and nanoribbons observed in the sub-10 nm regime.
  Here, the nanoribbons are much thicker, yet graphene's extremely high modulus
  leads to the observed increase in the measured composite moduli. Further, in
  these calculations, we consider the critical role of the nonlinear modulus
  component of graphene -its quadratic dependence on strain- which results from
  the lattice mismatch-induced interfacial strains between graphene and Pd.
  Graphene-Pd composite nanoribbons and thin films can be very useful for a wide
  range of application ranging from strain-engineered catalysis to damage
  tolerant flexible electronic devices. Beyond nanoribbons, the proposed 3D/2D
  rule of mixture model may be used to explain the modulus scaling in 3D/2D
  heterostructures and in bulk graphene-metal nanocomposites made by powder
  mixing routes.

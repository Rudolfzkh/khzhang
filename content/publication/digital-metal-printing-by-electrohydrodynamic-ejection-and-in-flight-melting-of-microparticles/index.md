abstract: Metal additive manufacturing (AM) will impact many industries,
  including those producting of advanced structural, propulsion, electronic, and
  thermal systems. Many established metal AM processes involve layer-by-layer
  deposition and selective binding or melting of metal powders. However, these
  processes do not easily permit multi-material printing or printing directly
  onto non-planar surfaces. By contrast, AM techniques that deposit metal
  directly are typically low resolution (e.g., directed energy deposition), or
  cannot achieve bulk metal properties (e.g., ink-based methods). Here, we
  present a high resolution direct metal printing method that potentially
  addresses these limitations. Individual metal microparticles are
  electrohydrodynamically ejected on-demand from a nozzle-confined meniscus and
  laser-melted in-flight before landing and solidifying on a substrate. We
  demonstrate printing of solder and platinum particles ranging in size from 30
  to 150 Âµm and explore the process parameter space as limited by the ejection
  conditions and the kinetics of melting, impact, and solidification. Our
  experiments demonstrate process compatibility with a wide range of powder
  feedstock materials, and tunability of the solidified morphology via the laser
  processing parameters.

abstract: Centimeter‐long palladium nanowires of diameters down to 250 nm are
  fabricated by a novel laser draw‐casting process. These wires are used in
  highly stretchable elastomeric conductors which afford up to 700% reversible
  stretching by forming in‐plane buckling without fracture, while maintaining
  electrical conductivity with less than 0.4% variation. This material system is
  promising for applications in flexible and wearable electronics.

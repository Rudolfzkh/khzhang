abstract: The mechanical behavior of high quality two-dimensional (2D) crystals
  offers exciting opportunities for new material design, such as the combination
  of extremely high in-plane stiffness and bending flexibility, compared to
  existing three-dimensional (3D) material forms. By combining different 2D
  crystals vertically or by in-plane stitching, unusual properties can arise due
  to nonlinear mechanical interactions between them. Van der Waals forces
  between vertically stacked crystals give rise to a wide range of useful
  phenomena such as layer-number dependent friction, superlubricity, creasing,
  and spatial modulation of elastic properties through Moir√© structures. In the
  present article, we review and explain the mechanical behavior of 2D materials
  and heterostructures (graphene, hexagonal boron nitride, transition metal
  dichalcogenides). Linear elastic properties of these 2D crystalline monolayers
  are well-studied using membrane nanoindentation towards their application in
  nano-electro-mechanical systems (NEMS) devices. On the other hand, a more
  thorough understanding of friction, fracture and stress transfer mechanisms
  between 2D layers and with the substrate or matrix is still lacking. More
  in-depth understanding of geometry-dependent behavior could enable the
  application of these materials in multi-functional composites. We discuss
  emerging opportunities achievable by assembling 2D heterostructures to tailor
  their mechanical behavior, and perhaps even break the traditional bounds
  limiting the properties of the bulk homostructures. Furthermore, to accelerate
  the design and discovery of the infinite combinations of new 2D
  heterostructures, we construct a crowd-sourced searchable online database to
  record and exploit the studies reporting on the complex arrangements of these
  crystals.

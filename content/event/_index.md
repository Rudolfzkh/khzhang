# Continued advancement in energy conversion, communication, transportation, and many other critical technologies relies on material innovations, which demand novel synthesis and manufacturing processes for emerging materials and structures. My research interests are predominantly in the study of structure and property interplay through the interface across different length scales to unlock nanomaterialsâ€™ properties at a macroscopic level. To achieve this, I plan to apply theories of material synthesis and assembly and material mechanics characterizations in conjunction with advanced manufacturing techniques (e.g. nanofabrication and additive manufacturing) to create synergy among the nanomaterial properties, structures, and processing. My research is built on the basis of multi-scale studies including, but not limited to:

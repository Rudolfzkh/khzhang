<span style="font-size: 0.7em; line-height: normal;"> Greetings! I am Kaihao Zhang. I am currently a Postdoctoral Associate at MIT, working with Prof. [John Hart](https://mechanosynthesis.mit.edu/). I will be joining the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou) as an Assistant Professor in Smart Manufacturing Thread in Systems Hub from 2021-11. I earned my M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in Mechanical Engineering at UIUC, advised by Prof. [Sameh Tawfick](https://tawfick.mechse.illinois.edu/). My doctoral research focused on **rapid synthesis of graphene** and **graphene-metal interface engineering for high performance graphene-based nanocomposites**. At HKUST(GZ), my research will focus on:</span>

* <span style="font-size: 0.7em;">**Metal Additive Manufacturing,**
* <span style="font-size: 0.7em;">**Advanced Nanomaterials Synthesis,**
* <span style="font-size: 0.7em;">**Metal Matrix Composites and Mechanics.**

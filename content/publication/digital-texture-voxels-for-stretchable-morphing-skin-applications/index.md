abstract: The skin of the cephalopod is a 3D display, where the papillae muscles
  control the protrusion of each voxel by several millimeters out of the skin
  plane, create hierarchical textures, and collectively change the overall skin
  pattern in a fraction of a second. A material system capable of mimicking this
  response using electromechanical actuation of twisted spiral artificial
  muscles (TSAMs) is presented in this study. TSAMs leverage the mechanics of
  their twisted geometry to extend out of plane by 8 mm, corresponding to 2000%
  strain using a voltage of only 0.02 V mm−1. They are made of polymer fibers
  wrapped with a helical metal wire. These actuators are assembled on a
  stretchable skin with the required flexible electrical connections to form an
  array of digital texture voxels (DTVs). The DTV array produces arbitrary 3D
  surface patterns on‐demand, and provides opportunities to control hydrodynamic
  drag, camouflage, and haptic displays.

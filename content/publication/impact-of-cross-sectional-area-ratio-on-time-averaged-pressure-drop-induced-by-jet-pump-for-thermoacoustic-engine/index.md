abstract: Gedeon streaming, a time-averaged mass flow circulating throughout the
  loop configuration in the oscillating flow, can considerably deteriorate the
  thermal efficiency of traveling-wave thermoacoustic engine. Jet pump is
  characterized by a tapered channel with different inlet and outlet areas. It
  can produce a time-averaged pressure drop to suppress Gedeon streaming. In
  this study, the suppression mechanism of the jet pump in oscillatory flow is
  investigated, and the emphasis is put on the effect of cross-sectional area
  ratio on the performance of jet pumps with different taper angles. An
  experimental apparatus has been built to measure the time-averaged pressure
  induced by the jet pump. When the taper angle ranges from 3° to 9°, the
  time-averaged pressure drop and working efficiency can be improved by
  increasing cross-sectional area ratio, and the change of taper angle has
  little effect on the performance of jet pumps. However, as the taper angle
  increases beyond 9°, the performance of jet pump with a large cross-sectional
  area ratio degrades considerably. In addition, the time-averaged pressure
  drops induced by the jet pumps with different cross-sectional area ratios are
  similar, and the taper angle becomes more dominant for jet pump’s performance.

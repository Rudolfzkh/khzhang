abstract: Owing to the capability to induce a time-averaged pressure drop in
  oscillatory flow, a jet pump has been used to suppress the Gedeon streaming in
  a looped thermoacoustic engine. The suppression capacity originates from the
  asymmetric pressure drop through the jet pump, and could be enhanced by
  rounding the edge of the jet pump in traditional view. This paper
  systematically probes the rounding effect on a jet pump and compares the
  performance of jet pumps with round and with sharp edge on small opening. The
  performance dependences on the taper angle and the cross-sectional area
  ratios, including the big-to-small opening area ratio of the jet pump and the
  small opening-to-pipe cross sectional area ratio, are analyzed and compared
  for the two types of jet pump. The results reveal a reversed and higher
  time-averaged pressure drop in the shape edge jet pump in contrast to that in
  the rounded jet pump. However, the round edge of the small opening can improve
  working efficiency of a jet pump.

abstract: Gilding is the ancient process of coating intricate artifacts with
  precious metals. Fascinating Egyptian and Chinese sculptures, coated with <200
  nm thin metal films by this process, have resisted corrosion, wear, and other
  environmental degradations for thousands of years. Here, 150 nm thin palladium
  leaves are enriched by doped with a single layer of graphene. Commercially
  available Pd leaves are uniquely suited for graphene synthesis by a highly
  dynamic chemical vapor deposition process. The Pd leaves made by high strain
  rate beating are stable at high synthesis temperature, resisting solid‐state
  dewetting owing to their extremely low grain triple junctions density (0.017
  µm−1). Mathematical models of growth kinetics guide the development of
  extremely rapid synthesis conditions, resulting in the formation of
  high‐quality graphene on Pd in less than a minute, owing to the graphene
  grains growing twice as fast as copper‐catalyzed growth. The graphene
  monolayer on the leaf increases the effective surface modulus by 59% to 236
  GPa. Uniaxial strain testing with Raman spectroscopy reveals the excellent
  crystallinity of graphene by probing the stress‐induced phonon shifts. This
  new material could open exciting opportunities in utilizing high‐quality 2D
  materials to coat large structures.

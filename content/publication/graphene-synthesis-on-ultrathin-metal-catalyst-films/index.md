abstract: Graphene synthesis on ultra-thin catalysts can allow the use of
  graphene-coated metal films in electronic applications. Graphene coated thin
  films are expected to offer superior mechanical performance owing to the
  strength of graphene. However, several factors need to be considered to assure
  the stability of thin films at the high temperatures required for graphene
  synthesis. In this work, we present a systematic framework for the selection
  of thin films (< 1 micron thickness) to be used as catalyst for graphene
  synthesis. We present our progress towards the rapid synthesis of graphene at
  1100Â°C in less than two minutes, thus avoiding solid state dewetting. The
  quality of the graphene is assessed by Scanning Electron Microscopy, Raman
  spectroscopy and indentation. It is shown that these films exhibit higher
  stiffness and resistance to crack propagation.

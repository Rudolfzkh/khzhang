abstract: Wrinkles invariably form during graphene growth and post-growth
  transfer, limiting graphene films' large-scale uniformity for electronic
  applications. We report a transfer-free synthesis route for highly-uniform
  bilayer graphene directly on dielectric substrates—SiO2, sapphire, and MgO—by
  interfacial carbon precipitation. Ultrathin Pd leaves having a thickness of
  150 nm and grain size up to 100 µm are laminated onto the target dielectric
  substrate, followed by annealing and press rolling to form a uniform
  Pd-substrate interface. Rapid heating in a hydrocarbon atmosphere causes
  carbon diffusion through the Pd layer; upon cooling, precipitation of carbon
  results in graphene growth at the Pd-substrate interface. The interface-grown
  graphene remains on the substrate after removing the Pd layer by wet etching.
  It exhibits sub-nm surface roughness without wrinkles or folds. Over 94% of
  the interface-grown area is dominated by bilayer graphene with low twist
  angles. In addition, the interface-grown graphene is nearly strain-free. From
  Raman characterization, an average long-range scattering mobility of ∼1000 cm2
  V-1 s-1 was estimated for as-grown bilayer graphene on sapphire (0001) at room
  temperature. This technique shows promise to achieve device scale,
  ultra-uniform graphene fabrication directly on dielectric substrates, with the
  potential to accelerate graphene applications in electronics, photonics, and
  sensing.

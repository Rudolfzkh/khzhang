  In order to improve the cooling performance of pulse tube cryocoolers (PTC), a
  novel configuration is proposed where a reservoir is added through an orifice
  valve to the cold end of pulse tube.

  The additional resistant element to the cold end helps to directly introduce the mass flow rate

  parallel to the pressure wave, which is beneficial to the cooling capacity. Thermodynamic relations

  between the cooling capacity, the coefficient of performance and various parameters were deduced

  for the novel configuration in orifice type and double-inlet type PTC with cold reservoir. Theoretical analysis shows that the cooling performance of the PTC can be improved significantly with the

  addition of a cold reservoir. Experiments with a home-made single stage Gifford-McMahon (GM)

  type PTC with a cold reservoir were also implemented for validation. Preliminary experimental

  results reveal that the cooling capacity of PTC was improved with minor opening of cold-end

  orifice valve. There exists an optimal opening of the cold-end orifice valve to improve the cooling

  performance.

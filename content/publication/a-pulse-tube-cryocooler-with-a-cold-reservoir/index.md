abstract: Phase difference between pressure wave and mass flow is decisive to
  the cooling capacity of regenerative cryocoolers. Unlike the direct phase
  shifting using a piston or displacer in conventional Stirling or GM
  cryocoolers, the pulse tube cyocooler (PTC) indirectly adjusts the cold phase
  due to the absence of moving parts at the cold end. The present paper proposed
  and validated theoretically and experimentally a novel configuration of PTC,
  termed cold reservoir PTC, in which a reservoir together with an adjustable
  orifice is connected to the cold end of the pulse tube. The impedance from the
  additional orifice to the cold end helps to increase the mass flow in phase
  with the pressure wave at the cold end. Theoretical analyses with the linear
  model for the orifice and double-inlet PTCs indicate that the cooling
  performance can be improved by introducing the cold reservoir. The preliminary
  experiments with a home-made single-stage GM PTC further validated the results
  on the premise of minor opening of the cold-end orifice.
